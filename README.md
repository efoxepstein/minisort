# The Challenge

Sort array `a` with length `i` in as few characters of C as possible.

Rules:
- Compile with `-Wall -Wextra -std=c99`
- No preprocessor directives allowed
- Must sort in ascending order
- Must be deterministic and always work

# Progress

I am down to 68 characters including whitespace.
Check out `minisort.c`.

If you can beat this, please fork and show me.
Write your code in `minisort.c`, the driver shouldn't need altering.
